# Exoplanet Analysis Project

## Project Objective
Comprehensive analysis of 5,000+ confirmed exoplanets from NASA Exoplanet Archive to identify classification patterns, validate physical relationships, and discover potentially habitable candidates using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Key Results

- **Classification Performance**: 96.3% accuracy in predicting detection methods using planetary characteristics (KNN & SVM)
- **Physical Validation**: Kepler's third law confirmed with 99.9% conformity across the dataset
- **Clustering Analysis**: 4 distinct planetary groups discovered through unsupervised learning
- **Density Classification**: 391 gaseous vs 209 rocky planets identified using ML-enhanced approach
- **Comparative Study**: ML approach (86.1% precision) vs simple threshold (83.7% agreement) for composition classification

## Dataset
- **Source**: NASA Exoplanet Archive
- **Size**: 5,903 confirmed exoplanets (after cleaning)

## Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Univariate and bivariate statistical analysis with log-scale transformations
- Correlation matrix analysis revealing key physical relationships (stellar mass â†” temperature: 0.46)
- Distribution analysis identifying observational biases toward massive, close-in planets
- Strategic data filtering to preserve maximum information while ensuring analysis quality

### 2. Physical Law Validation
- **Kepler's third law verification**: TÂ²/aÂ³ = 4Ï€Â²/G(M+m)
- Quantitative validation with mean difference â‰ˆ 2.25e-19
- Unit conversions: daysâ†’seconds, AUâ†’meters, Earth/Jupiter massesâ†’kg
- Outlier identification confirming measurement errors rather than physics violations

### 3. Classification Systems
- **Size Classification**: 8-category system (Mars-sized to Super-Jupiter-sized) based on radius
- **Density Classification**: Binary rocky/gaseous using 3.0 g/cmÂ³ threshold derived from solar system data
- **Temporal Analysis**: Previously verified vs newly verified Kepler planets
- **Comparative Study**: Threshold-based vs Logistic Regression approaches

### 4. Machine Learning Implementation
- **Unsupervised Learning**: K-Means clustering (k=4 optimal via elbow method)
- **Supervised Learning**: Multi-algorithm comparison (KNN: 96.3%, SVM: 96.3%, Logistic Regression: 86.1%)
- **Feature Engineering**: StandardScaler normalization, strategic feature selection
- **Model Validation**: Train/test split (70/30) with proper data preprocessing

### 5. Habitability Assessment
- **Criteria Definition**: Temperature (200-350K), radius (0.5-2 R_Earth), energy flux (0.8-1.2x Earth)
- **Training Data**: NASA exoplanet dataset with binary habitable/non-habitable classification
- **Predictive Modeling**: Logistic Regression achieving 100% accuracy on test set
- **Solar System Validation**: Post-training test on separately created solar system dataset
- **Validation Results**: Earth correctly identified as habitable, gas giants correctly classified as non-habitable
